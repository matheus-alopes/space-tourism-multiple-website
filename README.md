## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Javascript
- DOM manipulation

### What I learned

Through this project I could practice a lot of element positioning with CSS and important JS concepts on frontend programming, as DOM elements manipulation.

### Continued development

Talking about the future, my plans for continued development are all around an solid formation at the main frontend development skill set. This implies on making more projects like this one, to put in practice all relevant knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript; learn about React etc.

### Useful resources
